     * Executes JavaScript in the context of the currently selected frame or
     * window. The script fragment provided will be executed as the body of an
     * anonymous function.
     *
     * Within the script, use document to refer to the current document. Note
     * that local variables will not be available once the script has finished
     * executing, though global variables will persist.
     *
     * If the script has a return value (i.e. if the script contains a return
     * statement), then the following steps will be taken:
     *
     * - For an HTML element, this method returns a WebElement
     * - For a decimal, a Double is returned
     * - For a non-decimal number, a Long is returned
     * - For a boolean, a Boolean is returned
     * - For all other cases, a String is returned.
     * - For an array, return a List<Object> with each object following the rules above. We support nested lists.
     * - For a map, return a Map<String, Object> with values following the rules above.
     * - Unless the value is null or there is no return value, in which null is returned
     *
     * Arguments must be a number, a boolean, a String, WebElement, or a List
     * of any combination of the above. An exception will be thrown if the
     * arguments do not meet these criteria. The arguments will be made
     * available to the JavaScript via the "`arguments`" magic variable, as if
     * the function were called via "`Function.apply`"
     *
     * In the case of `async = true`, unlike executing synchronous JavaScript,
     * scripts executed with this method must explicitly signal they are
     * finished by invoking the provided callback. This callback is always
     * injected into the executed function as the last argument.
     *
     * The default timeout for a script to be executed is 0ms. In most cases,
     * including the examples below, one must set the script timeout
     * ([Timeouts.setScriptTimeout][org.openqa.selenium.WebDriver.Timeouts.setScriptTimeout])
